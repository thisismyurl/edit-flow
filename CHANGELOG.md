All users are encouraged to update.

### Security

### Fixed

* fix: keep post_date_gmt in sync when dragging posts on the calendar, and convert the quick-create timestamp to GMT when opted in by @GaryJones in [#1009](https://github.com/Automattic/edit-flow/pull/1009)

### Documentation

* docs: declare compatibility with WordPress 7.1 by @GaryJones in [#1039](https://github.com/Automattic/edit-flow/pull/1039)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-10

This release completes the security-review remediation begun in 0.10.4. It resolves the remaining issues from a full audit of the plugin's authenticated code paths — the headline stored XSS in the editorial-metadata location field, two information-disclosure issues (the iCal feed and the Story Budget), and a long tail of defence-in-depth hardening across access control, input handling, deserialisation, output escaping, and client-side code. None are known to be exploited in the wild, but all users are encouraged to update.

**Breaking:** the iCal subscription feed now uses a per-user, revocable secret instead of a single site-wide key. Existing calendar-subscription URLs will stop working, and each user must copy their new feed URL from the calendar's Screen Options. This is the reason for the minor version bump.

### Security
